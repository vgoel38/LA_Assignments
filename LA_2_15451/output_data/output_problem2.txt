----Reading Data----

----Mean vector and covariance matrix of the training data are saved----

----All eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data are saved----

----Only one eigenvalue 0 was found to repeat 116 times----

----All eigenvectors were found to be orthogonal----

----Gram-Schmidt Orthogonlisation was added----

----Function to reduce dimensions of the training data added----

----Reconstruction Error plot was plotted----

----Surface Curve plotted for accuracy at different k and m: Optimal values found were m=51, k=6 with highest accuracy achieved on validation set = 97.1% ----

----The data was plotted on 2D space and all the instances of same class label were found to be clustered----

----Accuracy achieved by KNN classifier in sklearn was 96.9%----
